What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    It creates a git repository where you can now create commits and start
    building a history. It's necessary so you can let git know what folders
    to be tracking.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    and files the are "committable" get 'saved' in the staging area.
