When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When working with other people or when you want to show other people the
    different versions of what you're working on. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    You might not always be ready or want to publically share whatever changes
    you're currently working on. Also, it gives you control over what, when 
    and how often to save. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks clone a repository within GitHub (GitHub to GitHub). Clones make 
    a complete copy from GitHub to a local repository or local to local. 
    Branches make a separate path for commits, used when you want to try out
    different things without affecting the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    The benefit is to know how far or behind you are in comparison to the 
    remote stored locally. It reminds you that you should update your work
    on GitHub or from GitHub as well.
