How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It saved me the tiring process of comparing every single line myself. If I 
    know one of the versions worked, all I need is to compare what's different
    between them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is very common do have to do revisions and changes to a program for the
    client. Having easy access to the version history would be essential if
    the client decides they want to revert back to an older version. It also
    helps with debugging purposes, since you can compare a working version to 
    a dysfunctional one.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are that you control what to commit, which is not always a 
    straight-forward decision. The biggest con is that you might forget to save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's not common for Google Docs to have files that affect each other with
    each change. In Git it's pretty common to have interlinked files that affect
    each other when changed.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log prints out all the history of commits done, including the commit
    ID's, which are necessary for using the git diff command. With the git
    diff command you can see what differs between file versions.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It allows me to easily switch back to an older version that did not break
    and compare it using 'git diff' to find out what might have caused it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Mainly for keeping an organized and easily accessible history of any changes
    I make to the first Android app I'm making.
